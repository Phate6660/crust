### cRUSTy ###

cRUSTy is a shell that I'm writing in Rust.
If there are any issues, feature requests, or whatever, feel free to open an issue.
As currently I'm just implementing whatever comes into mind.

The readline feature is now enabled by default now that I have fixed the issue with it. :D
If you wish to have a barebones prompt, disable the readline feature.
I will always support with and without line editing features.
Everyone has different preferences.

## Running ##

(running normally)
$ cargo run --release

(running a non-interactive command)
$ cargo run --release -- -c "echo this is an example"

## Features and TODO ##

- basic shell and prompt [done]
- builtins 
  + calc (syntax example: calc 2+2)
    * basic math operations mul/div/add/sub [done]
    * more advanced algorith / equation solving
    * PEMDAS
  + cd
    * changing directories with relative/exact paths [done]
    * cd without args takes you $HOME [done]
    * cd with '-' takes you to previous dir [done (can't use cd - two times in a row, stays in same dir)]
      (for more context see https://github.com/Phate6660/crusty/pull/4#issuecomment-908802180)
  + echo
    + basic echo functions [done]
    + escape sequence support
  + exit [done]
    * specify exit code [done]
  + help
    * display list of builtins [done]

  (Possible solution to piping and redirection: build a command running framework 
   which can recursively handle running commands, piping, and redirection all at once.)

    * can pipe between two programs [done]
    * can pipe between any amount of programs without restraint [done]
  + redirection
- readline support via rustyline
